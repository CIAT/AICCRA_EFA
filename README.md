AICCRA Economic and Financial Analysis Tool

The Aiccra EFA tool is designed to provide the high level Economic and Financial analysis (EFA) needed to inform programme development and evidence large-scale funding proposals. 

It is suitable for macro-scale planning, for example Global Climate Fund (GCF) proposals. In fact, this tool uses the approach employed in the EFA used to support the AICCRA project. We suggest you read the AICCRA EFA to understand how this tool can be employed.

The approach is simple and pragmatic. You choose countries, farming systems, one or more crops or livestock types for your project. Then you set some simple technology performance and project economic parameters. Tables and maps are output that can be saved and inserted in your proposal.

Please see the user guide for more information on how to use this tool: https://github.com/CIAT/AICCRA_EFA/raw/main/AICCRA%20EFA%20-%20User%20Guide.pdf
